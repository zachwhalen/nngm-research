# Notes on the Database

I'm just using this document as a scratchpad for thinking about what how I should structure and eventually share the database of NaNoGenMo books I've prepared. Partly, this also just a way to get a sense of the metadata I have or can get.

### Basic Metadata
 - Title - Obviously.
 - Author Github - Github profile name.
 - Author Name - If I now it.
 - Year - Which year's NaNoGenMo
 - Language - generally using ISO 639â€‘1, if possible.
 - Date Completed - Either when it was completed, or if I can't tell, when it received the completed label.
 - Issue - The issue number it was first described in.
 - Issue URL -- A link to that issue.
 - Code - Link to repository, gist, or whatever.
 - Example - A local path to the downloaded example I have.
 - Example Text - A local path to the plain text version of the example I have.
 - Wordcount - A basic `wc` on the plain text version.
 - License on code, if any.
 - License on sample, if any.

### Interpreted Data
 - Source text(s).
 - Composition Method or principle algorithm(s).
 - Programming language(s).
 - Summary.
 - Excerpt.

### Derived Data
 - Reading Level
 - Sentiment Analysis
 - Characteristic Curve Comparisons to specific sorce
 - PCA vectors
 - POS counts from TextBlob. Maybe?
 - Can I extract place names?
